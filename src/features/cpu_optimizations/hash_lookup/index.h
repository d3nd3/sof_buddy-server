// Hash index over the engine's cvar / command / alias lists.
//
// The engine keeps all three as singly-linked lists that, while the server is
// running, are only ever *prepended* to. That is checked over the whole image,
// not just the list heads - see README.md: there is exactly one store to any
// cvar_t.next in the binary (the prepend itself), nothing takes the address of
// cvar_vars or cmd_alias, and the only Z_Free of a cvar `name` is in an exit
// teardown. Each list does have a bulk destructor, but all three are atexit
// handlers (which is why they appear to have no callers). So the index is
// cheap to keep coherent: a lookup compares the current head against the head
// we last indexed and, when they differ, walks only the newly prepended
// prefix.
//
// Commands are the one list with a destructive operation - Cmd_RemoveCommand
// Z_Frees the node - so that function is patched to invalidate the whole
// command index first. Removals are rare; a full rebuild there is far simpler
// to reason about than a surgical erase, and it can never leave a freed node
// reachable from the table.
//
// These entry points are what the assembly stubs call. They run on the
// engine's own thread, inside the engine function whose scan they replaced.
