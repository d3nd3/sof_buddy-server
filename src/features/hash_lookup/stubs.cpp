// Assembly bridges from the engine's patched scan loops into the hash index.
//
// Each stub is entered by a jmp that overwrote the head of a linear search,
// and leaves through one of that same function's own labels with the node in
// the register the engine's loop would have left it in. Nothing else about the
// function changes, so latching, CVAR_INTERNAL gating, info validation, alias
// loop counting and every other behaviour stays literal engine code.
//
// Contract at every entry:
//   * esp is exactly what the engine had - the stubs restore it before
//     leaving, and the surrounding function still reads its arguments through
//     [esp+N].
//   * ebx / esi / edi / ebp hold whatever the engine put there. The cdecl call
//     preserves them, and each stub sets only the one register its re-entry
//     label expects. eax / ecx / edx are scratch: the loop we replaced
//     clobbered them too, and every re-entry label writes them before reading.
//
// GCC has no `naked` attribute on x86, so these are module-level asm. Jump
// targets are memory-indirect through globals rather than immediates: this is
// a DLL, and the engine addresses are only known once its module base is
// resolved at install time.
